--Point Particles: Simulate tiny dots moving according to certain rules, like fireflies or raindrops.
--Images/Text Particles: Use images or text elements as particles for visual effects like smoke or explosions.
--Attraction/Repulsion: Simulate particles that attract or repel each other, like magnetic fields or swarming behaviors.
--Brownian Motion: Simulate random particle movements mimicking microscopic phenomena.
--Flocking/Swarming: Simulate group behaviors where particles move cohesively, like schools of fish or flocks of birds.
--Spring Systems: Simulate interconnected particles with spring-like forces, like chains or hair.
--Fluid Dynamics: Simulate fluid-like behavior with particle interactions, like smoke or water.
--Collision Detection: Simulate particle collisions with bouncing or merging effects.
--External Forces: Simulate particles reacting to external forces like gravity or wind.
--Interactive Particles: Allow user interaction to influence particle movement, like creating ripples in water or attracting particles with the mouse.
